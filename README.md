# Portfolio website - Jakub Figlak

This is the first project I made during Coder's Camp 2019 edition. Actually, it is the very first project I have ever made. Good for me! This is just a simple portfolio website, meant to tell people a little bit about me and let them contact me. For now, I can't see any reason why they would do that, but maybe in the future, who knows.

## Requirements

This task was supposed to prove, that I am familiar with the following issues:
- box-model,
- cascade,
- CSS selectors,
- HTML tags,
- adding CSS stylesheet to HTML file,
- defining colors,
- text styling,
- external fonts and icons (googlefonts, fontawesome),
- flexbox,
- position (absolute, fixed, relative),
- keyframes animations.

I really hope it does that.

## Project status

For now it's just basic HTML + CSS, it needs a lot of improvement. Hope to get back to it when I learn some JS!

## Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Screenshots

Here you can take a look at the website's screenshot for desktop
